These are assignments I have completed as a part of the 2MD3-"Data Structures and Algorithms for Mechatronics" course at McMaster University. The course covered topics such as : **re- and post-conditions, loop and datatype invariants; use of tools to demonstrate correctness. Selecting data structures for implementation of mathematical abstractions. Finite state machines, automata and languages; lexing and parsing. Algorithm analysis (time and space). Modelling of graphs, relations, corresponding algorithms.**
